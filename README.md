# automating-toggl

Are you lazy and don't want to toggl manually?  Then run the batch script provided in Windows Scheduler or set up a CRON job to have your Toggl automatically populate from your Google Calendar entries.

### Note:

Within `toggleservice.py`, change out the `toggl_pid` to match the project id you want to associate with your entries - else leave it blank.
